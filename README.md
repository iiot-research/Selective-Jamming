# Selective-Jamming
Codes and data for selective jamming to WirelessHART networks

We have identified a new threat to WirelessHART networks, namely smart selective jamming attacks, where the attacker first cracks the channel usage, routes, and parameter configuration of the victim network and then jams the transmissions of interest on their specific communication channels in their specific time slots, which makes the attacks energy efficient and hardly detectable.

# Smart-Selective-Jamming-Attacks
The smart selective jamming attacks significantly reduce the WirelessHART network reliability without triggering network updates. This jamming method has been evalauted using the physcial testbed data traces.
